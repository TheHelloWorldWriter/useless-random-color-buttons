USELESS RANDOM COLOR BUTTONS (OFFLINE EDITION)
By The Hello World Writer
=============================================================================

WHAT IS THIS?
-------------
Click colored buttons that spawn and pile up all over your screen. Fight the 
rising visual chaos, track your clicking stats, and try to clear the mess.

This is a "useless" time waster built with Vanilla JS. I created this 
single-file version so you can keep it on a USB drive, save it to your 
desktop, or play it when you don't have an internet connection.


HOW TO RUN IT
-------------
1. Unzip the archive.
2. Locate the file named "urcbuttons.html".
3. Double-click it.

It should open automatically in your default web browser (Chrome, Firefox, 
Safari, Edge, etc.). No internet connection is required.


COMPATIBILITY
-------------
This is a standard HTML5 application. It works on:
- Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Any modern web browser.

Note for Mobile Users: Opening local HTML files on Android or iOS can be 
tricky and may require specific file manager apps. It is recommended to play 
on a desktop or laptop.
