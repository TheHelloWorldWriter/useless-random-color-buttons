USELESS RANDOM COLOR BUTTONS (OFFLINE EDITION)
By The Hello World Writer
https://www.thehelloworldwriter.com/
=============================================================================


WHAT IS THIS?
-------------

Click colored buttons that spawn and pile up all over your screen. Fight the
rising visual chaos, track your clicking stats, and try to clear the mess.


HOW TO RUN IT
-------------

1.  Unzip the archive.

2.  Locate the file named `urcbuttons.html`.

3.  Double-click it.

The app will open immediately in your default web browser. No internet
connection is required.


WAIT, WHERE IS THE EXECUTABLE FILE?
-----------------------------------

You might be looking for an .exe (Windows), an .app file (macOS), or a binary
executable (Linux). You won't find one. That is by design.

Web apps are usually run online - and you can play this one online too at
https://urcbuttons.helloworldwriter.com/.

However, this is a completely offline version. I distributed it as a standard
HTML file because it works everywhere. You just open it in your browser, and the
app runs.

It also saves space. If I had converted this to a native desktop app (using
Electron or similar tools), the file size would be huge. By keeping it as pure
web code, the entire app is only 85KB (and the ZIP archive is just 63KB). It's
simple, lightweight, and it works.


FILES IN THIS FOLDER
--------------------

`urcbuttons.html` - The app (run this).

`itim-v16-latin-regular.woff2` - The font file. Keep this in the same folder as
the HTML file for the text to look right.

`LICENSE` - The MIT License text.

`README.txt` - This file.


COMPATIBILITY
-------------

Since this is a standard HTML5 application, it works on any modern device:

  - Windows (Edge, Chrome, Firefox)
  - macOS (Safari, Chrome, Firefox)
  - Linux (Firefox, Chromium)
  - Android & iOS (Chrome, Safari, etc.)

Note for mobile users: Open `urcbuttons.html` from your device's Files app and 
choose a browser. If a tap doesn't open it, long‑press the file or use the Share
menu and select "Open in" or "Open with" to pick a browser.
